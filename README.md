# Learning Rust
My small repo for keeping track of my journey into the world of [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Projects
The projects in this repo will mainly be based on the chapters from [`The Rust Book`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) and ['The Burn Book'](https://burn.dev/book).

My goal with this repo is to go through the following process: 
1. Learn the fundamentals of Rust.
2. Learn the fundamentals of the Rust framework [`Burn`](https://github.com/Tracel-AI/burn).
3. Implement a model training using Burn.
4. Implement a model inference API using some Rust framework.
    * E.g. using [`Actix`](https://actix.rs/) or ['Rocket'](https://rocket.rs/).
